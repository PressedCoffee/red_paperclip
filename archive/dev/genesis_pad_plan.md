# Genesis Pad Autonomous Agent Simulation Backend Planning Document

## 1. Project Overview

The Genesis Pad project aims to build a modular, extensible backend simulation environment for autonomous agents. These agents form identities, set goals, trade, interact publicly, and evolve through modular components integrated with external services. The system supports symbolic trade, narrative emergence, and behaviorally rich value expression.

## 2. Core Modules

- **Genesis Pad Engine**: Manages agent sessions, journaling, and capsule generation.
- **Genesis Capsule Registry**: Stores and manages Genesis Capsules representing agent identities and states.
- **Agent Identity System**: Handles agent profiles, authentication, and identity persistence.
- **Trading Logic Module**: Implements agent trading behaviors, negotiation, and value exchange.
- **Farcaster Integration**: Connects to Farcaster API for decentralized social interactions and public agent statements.
- **Public Display Layer**: Manages public-facing agent data, snippets, and interactions.
- **Badge & XP System**: Tracks agent achievements, experience points, and progression.
- **Goal Reevaluation Module (G.R.E.M.)**: Periodically reassesses agent goals and motivations to adapt behavior.

## 3. Architecture Requirements

- **Modularity**: Each module is independently developed and replaceable.
- **Configurability**: Support for runtime configuration and parameter tuning.
- **LLM-agnostic Design**: Abstract interfaces to support multiple LLM providers.
- **Storage-agnostic Data Handling**: Flexible data storage backends (e.g., databases, files).
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between modules and external systems.

## 4. File and Module Layout

- `/genesis_pad/`: Core engine and session management code.
- `/agents/`: Agent behavior, identity, and lifecycle management.
- `/registry/`: Capsule storage and registry services.
- `/integration/`: External API connectors (Farcaster, LLM providers, prediction markets).
- `/public_display/`: Public interaction and display components.
- `/badges_xp/`: Badge and experience tracking logic.
- `/goal_reevaluation/`: G.R.E.M. module implementation.
- `/utils/`: Shared utilities and helpers.
- `/tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

## 5. Agent Lifecycle and Data Flow

- **Initialization**: Agent identity creation and capsule registration.
- **Journaling**: Agent session prompts and responses recorded.
- **Goal Formation**: Capsule generation and goal setting.
- **Trading**: Agents engage in value exchange via trading logic.
- **Public Interaction**: Agents publish snippets and interact via Farcaster.
- **Reevaluation**: G.R.E.M. module updates goals and motivations.
- **Data Flow**: Data moves between modules via APIs and shared storage; external systems integrated via connectors.

## 6. Integration Points

- **LLM Providers**: Abstracted interfaces to query language models for agent responses.
- **Farcaster API**: For decentralized social posting and agent public presence.
- **Prediction Markets**: For agent trading and value estimation.
- **Storage Backends**: Databases or file systems for capsule and session data.

## 7. Priorities

- Emphasize modularity for ease of development and maintenance.
- Maintain clarity in interfaces and data structures.
- Design for long-term extensibility and adaptability.

## 8. Coinbase AgentKit + CDP Integration

- **Smart Wallet Creation and Ownership**: Each agent will be assigned a CDP Wallet during Genesis Capsule creation using AgentKitâ€™s wallet provider, enabling full on-chain autonomy.
- **NFT Support**: Agents receive a soulbound Red Paperclip NFT as their initial on-chain asset, establishing unique identity and ownership.
- **Autonomous Transactions**: Agents can perform symbolic or utility-driven payments using x402pay, facilitating autonomous economic interactions.
- **On-Chain Trading**: Built-in AgentKit primitives enable agents to trade assets and interact with smart contracts, supporting badge minting, asset evolution, and other advanced features.
- **Pinecone Memory Integration**: AgentKit will be paired with Pinecone vector databases to store trade history, reflections, and experiences per agent in separate namespaces, enabling memory-aware behavior.
- **Narrative-Rich Symbolic Economies**: The integration is designed to explore complex emergent behaviors beyond financial optimization, where agents pursue diverse goals and meaningful interactions.
- **HTTP-Native Microtransactions**: x402pay may be selectively integrated to support paywalled resources, rituals, or inter-agent tipping, enhancing the richness of agent interactions.
- **Vision**: This positions Genesis Pad as a pioneering project exploring the intersection of self-motivated AI agents and verifiable on-chain autonomy, enabling new forms of digital behavior and economy.
