# Simulations Module

## Purpose and Scope

The `simulations/` module provides various simulation frameworks for multi-agent interactions, including coalition formation, integrated simulations, and trade loop simulations. It models agent behaviors, interactions, and coalition dynamics in a controlled environment.

## Key Classes and Roles

- **CoalitionFormation**: Manages the formation, acceptance, dissolution, and merging of coalitions among agents.
- **AutonomousAgent**: Represents an agent participating in simulations with goals and interaction capabilities.
- **Simulation Functions**: Includes functions to run integrated simulations, multi-agent interactions, and trade loops.

## Usage

Simulations are run by creating agents and invoking simulation functions to model interactions and coalitions.

Example:

```python
from simulations.coalition_formation import CoalitionFormation
from simulations.multi_agent_interaction import run_simulation

agents = create_agents(5)
coalition_manager = CoalitionFormation(agents)
run_simulation()
```

## Chaos Pack Notes

Simulations may integrate with Chaos Pack modules for enhanced cognitive features and meta-reasoning during simulation runs.

## Dependencies and Integration

- Depends on `agents` for agent definitions.
- Integrates with `negotiation` for coalition payoff splits.
- Uses `memory` for tracking agent histories.
- Works with `trading` for trade simulations.
