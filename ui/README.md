# UI Module

## Purpose and Scope

The `ui/` module contains user interface components for visualizing agent data and interactions. It includes badge visualization, interaction mapping, public dashboards, snapshot panels, and social feeds to provide insights into agent states and social dynamics.

## Key Classes and Roles

- **BadgeVisualization**: Renders badges and XP for agents.
- **InteractionMap**: Tracks and exports agent-to-agent interactions and coalition memberships.
- **PublicDashboard**: Aggregates social feed, interaction map, and snapshot panel data for display.
- **SnapshotPanel**: Provides detailed snapshots of agent states including badges, mood, and visibility preferences.
- **SocialFeed**: Manages social posts, event logs, and trade reflections.

## Usage

UI components are used to visualize agent data and interactions in dashboards or reports.

Example:

```python
from ui.interaction_map import InteractionMap

interaction_map = InteractionMap()
interaction_map.record_interaction("agent1", "agent2", "trade")
snapshot = interaction_map.export_snapshot(step=1)
```

## Chaos Pack Notes

UI modules can display data generated by Chaos Pack cognitive features such as capsule drift reports and meta-reasoning outputs.

## Dependencies and Integration

- Integrates with `agents` for agent data.
- Uses `memory` for historical interaction data.
- Works with `simulations` and `negotiation` for coalition and social dynamics visualization.
- Interfaces with `visibility` to respect agent data sharing preferences.
